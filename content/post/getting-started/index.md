Come Sunday at 6 p.m. (GMT-5) Mexican citizens will have had elected not only a new president, but also over 3,400 new public officials. Being the [largest electoral process in Mexican History](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/mexico-2018-election-overview/), this third federal voting round in the post-transition era determines not only Mexico’s future, but —along with several [other elections in the region](http://www.as-coa.org/content/guide-2018-latin-american-elections)— it also helps configure the [ideological composition of Latin America](https://latinamericandiaries.blogs.sas.ac.uk/2016/11/16/the-return-of-the-right-in-latin-america/).

Instead of providing [an overview of the contenders](https://www.bakerinstitute.org/mexico-presidential-candidates/) or discussing the trade-offs and the potential risks of the populist left, I will a) assess the campaign, b) zero in on the topics to look out for during and after election day and lastly, I will also c) identify key challenges for the future. My assumption or rather my concern is that, while it is interesting to talk about [polls and effective vote intention](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-mexican-election/index.html), there are larger-than-victorissues that will heavily condition not only the consolidation, but ultimately the survivalof Mexican democracy.
