Despite recent contributions, subnational democratic variation has received little systematic attention in comparative politics and has been a grave omission (Dahl 1971, 12) in the literature about democratization. Moreover, existing explanations have been articulated around case studies, reducing our ability to build a broad theory about this phenomenon. To overcome current limitations, my DPhil thesis examines democracy at the subnational level across the largest federations in Latin America.
